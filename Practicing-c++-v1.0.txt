Time: 4 weeks - 30% efforts 
- Start : 01-Aug-2023

1. Goal: Hands on C++ experiences
    1.1  OOP concept - Smart Pointer
	1.2. Cmake build system
	1.3  Design patterns
	1.4. Software Design
	1.5. UML diagram (class diagram, sequence diagram, component diagram)
	1.6. Unit testing (gmock, gtest) - generate by LCOV

2. Environment:
    - Build and run on Linux.
	- Code will be stored on Gerrit.

3. Expected output
	3.1. Understand OOP and can design the software to use OOP effectively. Must use smart pointer for creating pointers.
	3.2. Can config the project to build with Cmake.
	3.3. Use at least 2 different design patterns in the design. (Factory Pattern, Decorator Pattern + Template).
	3.4. Has UML diagram about design of the software. Requires at least component diagram, class diagram and sequence diagram of main flow.
	3.5. Config project to run unit test and generate coverage report. Requires at least 10% branch coverage and 100% file coverage.
	3.6. UT with 85% condition coverage (optional).
	
4. Problem 1 - The HearthStone
	- This is a game bases on "HearthStones: Heroes of Warcraft" game of Blizzard. You should take a look at the original game concept first (on google).

	4.2. Definition of Done
		4.2.1. Game is built (with Cmake) and run successfully.
		4.2.2. All requirements are fulfilled.
		4.2.3. Use at least 2 design patterns in the software
		4.2.4. At least component diagram, class diagram and sequence diagram of main flow are available.
		4.2.5. Unit test report with at least 10% branch coverage and 100% file coverage.
5. Problem 2 - The HearthStone - Extension pack
	- Do this after complete "The HearthStone".
	5.1. Requirements
		5.1.1. Every 2 turns, the player receives a random card from the board.
		5.1.2. 2 players shall be able to play the game from 2 different device (terminal).
